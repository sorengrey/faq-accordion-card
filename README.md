## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was great practice for CSS positioning, particularly getting better about using position: absolute and z-index. I had to implement them both to keep the box and hero images from moving downward when the dropdown menu was opened.

It also gave me the opportunity to brush up on my jQuery skills. I spent a while researching on w3schools and Stack Overflow to get the dropdown menu's functionality just right.

### Continued development

While this project is done, I may come back and tweak the margins and padding a little here and there. If you have any suggestions for anything else, I'd love to hear them!
